.SH NAME
PARU \- AUR Helper

.SH SYNOPSIS
/etc/paru.conf
.sp
~/.config/paru/paru.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION
Paru's config file. Based on the format used by \fBpacman.conf (5)\fR.

Paru will attempt to read the config file from the user's home directory. If that does not exist
paru will instead attempt to read the file from the system config directory.

Aditionally the \fBInclude\fB directive can be used to copy paste files into the config. This could be used
to extend the system config by including it in your user's config and then defining options.

.SH OPTIONS

Options belonging to the [options] section.

.TP
.B TopDown
Print search results from top to bottom.

.TP
.B BottomUp
Print search results from bottom to top.

.TP
.B AurOnly
Assume all targets are from the AUR. Additionally Actions such as
sysupgrade will only act on AUR packages.

Note that dependency resolving will still act normally and include repository
packages.

.TP
.B RepoOnly
Assume all targets are from the repositories. Additionally Actions such as
sysupgrade will only act on repository packages.

.TP
.B SudoLoop
Loop sudo calls in the background to prevent sudo from timing out during long
builds.

.TP
.B NoCheck
Don't resolve checkdepends or run the check function.

.TP
.B Devel
During sysupgrade also check AUR development packages for updates. Currently
only Git packages are supported.

Devel checking is done using \fBgit ls-remote\fR. The newest commit hash is
compared against the hash at install time. This allows devel updates to be
checked almost instantly and not require the original pkgbuild to be downloaded.

.TP
.B CleanAfter
Remove untracked files after installation.

Untracked files are removed with the exception of directories.
This allows VCS packages to easily pull an update
instead of having to reclone the entire repo.

.TP
.B Provides
Look for matching providers when searching for AUR packages. When multiple
providers are found a menu will appear prompting you to pick one. This
increases dependency resolve time although this should not be noticeable.

.TP
.B PgpFetch
Prompt to import unknown PGP keys from the \fBvalidpgpkeys\fR field of each
PKGBUILD.

.TP
.B CombinedUpgrade
During sysupgrade, paru will first perform a refresh, then show
its combined menu of repo and AUR packages that will be upgraded. Then after
reviewing the pkgbuilds, the repo and AUR upgrade will start with no need
for manual intervention.

If paru exits for any reason After the refresh without upgrading. It is then
the user's responsibility to either resolve the reason paru exited or run
a sysupgrade through pacman directly.

.TP
.B BatchInstall
When building and installing AUR packages instead of installing each package
after building, queue each package for install. Then once either all packages
are built or a package in the build queue is needed as a dependency to build
another package, install all the packages in the install queue.

.TP
.B UseAsk
Use pacman's --ask flag to automatically confirm package conflicts. paru lists
conflicts ahead of time. It is possible that paru does not detect
a conflict, causing a package to be removed without the user's confirmation.
However, this is very unlikely.

.TP
.B Redownload [= All]
Always download pkgbuilds of targets even when a copy is available in cache.
If all is used then this applies to all packages, not only targets.

.TP
.B Rebuild [= All]
Always build target packages even when a copy is available in cache.
If all is selected then all packages are rebuilt, not only targets.

.TP
.B RemoveMake [= Ask]
Remove makedepends after installing packages. Defaults to yes.

.TP
.B UpgradeMenu
Show a detailed list of updates in a similar format to VerbosePkgLists.
Upgrades can also be skipped using numbers, number ranges or repo names.
Additionally ^ can be used to invert the selection.

Additionally an argument can be passed to this flag and the menu will use
this input instead of reafing from stdin.

\fBWarning\fR: It is not recommended to skip updates from the repositories as
this can lead to partial upgrades. This feature is intended to easily skip AUR
updates on the fly that may be broken or have a long compile time. Ultimately
it is up to the user what upgrades they skip.

.TP
.B AurUrl = URL
Set an alternative AUR URL. This is mostly useful for users in China who wish
to use https://aur.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/.

.TP
.B BuildDir = /path/to/dir
Directory to use for Building AUR Packages. This directory is also used as
the AUR cache when deciding if paru should skip builds.

.TP
.B SortBy = Votes|Popularity|Id|Baseid|Name|Base|Submitted|Modified

.TP
.B SearchBy = name|name-desc|maintainer|depends|checkdepends|makedepends|optdepends>

.TP
.B CompletionInterval = N
Time in days to refresh the completion cache. Setting this to 0 will cause
the cache to be refreshed every time, while setting this to -1 will cause the
cache to never be refreshed.

.TP
.B RequestSplit = Number
The maximum amount of packages to request per AUR query. The higher the
number the faster AUR requests will be. Requesting too many packages in one
AUR query will cause an error. This should only make a noticeable difference
with very large requests (>500) packages.

.TP
.B PacmanConof = path/to/pacman.conf
The pacman config file to use.

.SH BIN

Options belonging to the [bin] section.

.TP
.B Makepkg = path/to/makepkg
The command to use for \fBmakepkg\fR calls. This can be a command in
\fBPATH\fR or an absolute path to the file.

.TP
.B Pacman = path/to/pacman
The command to use for \fBpacman\fR calls. This can be a command in
\fBPATH\fR or an absolute path to the file.

.TP
.B Git = path/to/git
The command to use for \fBgit\fR calls. This can be a command in
\fBPATH\fR or an absolute path to the file.

.TP
.B Asp = path/to/asp
The command to use for \fBasp\fR calls. This can be a command in
\fBPATH\fR or an absolute path to the file.

.TP
.B Sudo = path/to/sudo
The command to use for \fBsudo\fR calls. This can be a command in
\fBPATH\fR or an absolute path to the file.
The sudoloop is not guaranteed to work with a custom \fBsudo\fR command.

.TP
.B FileManager = path/to/fm
This enables fm review mode, where pkgbuild review is done using the file
manager specified by command.

.TP
.B MFlags = Flags...
Passes arguments to makepkg. These flags get passed to every instance where
makepkg is called by paru. Arguments are split on whitespace before being
passed to makepkg.

.TP
.B GitFlags = Flags...
Passes arguments to git. These flags get passed to every instance where
git is called by paru. Arguments are split on whitespace before being
passed to git.
.TP

.B GpgFlags = Flags...
Passes arguments to gpg. These flags get passed to every instance where
gpg is called by paru. Arguments are split on whitespace before being
passed to gpg.

.TP
.B SudoFlags = Flags...
Passes arguments to sudo. These flags get passed to every instance where
sudo is called by paru. Arguments are split on whitespace before being
passed to sudo.

.TP
.B FileManagerFlags = Flags...
Passes arguments to file manager. These flags get passed to every instance where
file manager is called by paru. Arguments are split on whitespace before being
passed to file manager.
